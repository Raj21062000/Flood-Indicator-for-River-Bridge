# Flood-Indicator-for-River-Bridge

Floor indicator for river bridge is basically a project that is an indicator for flood or rise in water level when we are on a bridge during monsoon season. 
It happens many a times that during the monsoon or rainy season when people are on bridge the water level below the bridge rises suddenly and people do not get aware about this and they get struct in between the bridge. During this time there is high chances of traffic jam and people do not get off the bridge easily. Due to this many accidents occur.
So to overcome this problem we have designed this project. In this project we have installed metal bars below the column of the bridge. These bars are installed vertically and we have made holes on the surface of road of the bridge at its end. 

Working of our project - 
When water level below the bridge rises then these metal bars come up with the help of thrust(force) indicating people that the water level is rising and they have to immediately get off from the bridge.
